<p>1) If you do design too early, you'll waste your efforts. </p>
<p>2) If you never do design, your code will become a painful mess. </p>
<p>3) A time will come when investing in design will save you money. </p>
<p>4) Simple procedures require little design and are cheap to maintain. </p>
<p>5) Procedures become more complex over time, and more expensive to maintain. </p>
<p>6) Object-oriented code is more cost-effective than complex procedural code. </p>
<p>7) The procedures that are most important to your domain change more than those that are incidental to your domain.</p>
<p>8) The procedures that are important to your domain increase in complexity faster than other code.</p>
<p>9) It's difficult to be aware of the exact moment when your application crosses the design payoff line. </p>
<p>10) You become aware that you have passed the design payoff line because velocity slows and suffering increases.</p>
<p>11) The most important code will be the most out-of-control by the time you realize you've passed the design payoff line.</p>
<p>12) Moderately complex procedures are easy to convert to OO.</p>
<p>13) Extremely complex procedures are more difficult to convert to OO.</p>
<p>14) Your attempts to convert moderately complicated procedures to OO generally succeed.</p>
<p>15) Your attempts to convert extremely complicated procedures to OO often fail.</p>
