Usually I'm working with CircleCI - it's good for private projects.
But new feature from Github is free for public repo's so I've decided to give it a try.

GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows - CI/CD. Build, test, and
deploy your code right from GitHub.

Here is my example of configuration for Ruby on Rails project to run Rubocop, RSpec unit and RSpec Capybara feature specs. I guess ENV part can be decoupled and moved outside, but for now I'm ok with it.

{% highlight yaml %}
name: Rspec and Rubocop CI

on: [push,pull_request]

jobs:
  rubocop-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Rubocop
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: 2.6
      - name: Install Rubocop gem
        run: gem install rubocop
      - name: Run Rubocop
        run: rubocop app spec # I want specify only `app` and `spec` folders to inspect
  rspec-test:
    name: RSpec
    needs: rubocop-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:11.6
        ports: ["5432:5432"]
        options: --health-cmd pg_isready --health-interval 10s --health-timeout 5s --health-retries 5
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: 2.6
      - name: Install PostgreSQL
        run: sudo apt-get -yqq install libpq-dev
      - name: Create local database
        env:
          RAILS_ENV: test
          PGHOST: 127.0.0.1
          PGUSER: postgres
        run: |
          gem install bundler
          bundle install --jobs 4 --retry 3
          bundle exec rails webpacker:install
          bundle exec rails db:create
          bundle exec rails db:migrate
      - name: Build and test with rspec
        env:
          RAILS_ENV: test
          PGHOST: 127.0.0.1
          PGUSER: postgres
        run: bundle exec rspec spec/models spec/forms spec/requests # run only unit specs here
      - name: setup-chromedriver
        uses: nanasess/setup-chromedriver@v1.0.1
      - name: Run capybara
        env:
          RAILS_ENV: test
          PGHOST: 127.0.0.1
          PGUSER: postgres
        run: bundle exec rspec spec/features # run only feature specs here
{% endhighlight %}

Happy coding!
